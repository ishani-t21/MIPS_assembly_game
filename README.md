# The Last Platform  

A 2D platformer game built in MIPS Assembly for the CSCB58 course.  

---

## **Game Overview**  
**The Last Platform** is a 2D platformer where the player navigates platforms, avoids enemies, and collects a special pickup to win. The player can shoot enemies to disable them temporarily, but colliding with enemies costs lives. The game ends when the player either collects the pickup (win) or loses all three lives (game over).
